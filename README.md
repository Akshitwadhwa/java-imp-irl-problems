# java-imp-irl-problems
this is a repo containing different in real life problem statement questions that can be solved using Java
I have compiled a list of many java problems with class and objects , static blocks, inheritance, scanner classes, etc.
these are very common in lab questions asked during interviews and many other lab examinations based upon the java.
